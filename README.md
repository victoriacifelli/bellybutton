# Project Title:  King of the Jungle: Bacterial Domination of the Belly Button
# Project done at Cal Poly Humboldt in BIOL 580- Bioinformatics
#Participants: Victoria Cifelli- Cal Poly Humboldt, Department of Biological Sciences
#I am using the data from Hulcr et al. (2012) to determine the most abundant, or dominant, species of bacteria present. I hypothesize that the dominant bacteria species will be the same in most of the belly button samples. I expect to find that the dominant bacteria species in the belly button will be the same of that on the skin: Staphylococcus. I will establish the dominant bacteria living in the belly button by comparing the various abundances of all bacteria presence. The taxa that is the most abundant will be characterized as the dominant taxa.
	The belly button is a unique/niche environment in the body because it does not lead to internal organs as other cavities do. The belly button creates a warm, dark, and sometimes moist environment depending on the person it belongs to. Focusing on the dominant bacteria taxa in the belly button allows us to do many things. We can use this information to compare other dominant taxa in other areas of the body. We can also use this information to help us understand fungal and bacterial infections that are very common in the belly button. 
	The data type I will be looking at are pyrosequencing reads (nucleotides). The source of this dataset will come from datadryad.org. The authors of this paper used QIIME as their pipeline software. My new approach to this dataset is to use their phylogeny outputs from QIIME and run it through Phyloseq to create new plots on dominance.
